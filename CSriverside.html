        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Riverside Art Center aims to host local art events and connect local artists with the community. We have observed that users have a difficult time navigating the booking process on the event page and understanding the benefits of membership. This is causing users to not attend events, artists not being seen, and the loss of donations.</p>
